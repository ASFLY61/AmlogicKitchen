Kitchen for working with the first level of Amlogic firmware
-------------------------------------------------- -----

Instruction:

1) to unpack the firmware, take the UBT Image (.img) file and put it in the in folder.
If the name is confusing, rename it to something simple, like ax95.img

2) click _unpack_level1.bat

3) in the level1 folder, we replace / edit the files:

aml_sdc_burn.UBOOT - bootloader, file 1
DDR.USB - bootloader, file 2. change simultaneously with f.1

boot.PARTITION - kernel

_aml_dtb.PARTITION - kernel settings file

recovery.PARTITION - recovery

logo.PARTITION - logo (sometimes depends on the loader).

odm.PARTITION -
product.PARTITION -
system.PARTITION -
vendor.PARTITION - these 4 partitions contain system files.

4) click _pack_level1.bat, in the out folder we take the finished img file
   to create full OTA, click _pack_level1_fota.bat
   
5) enjoy.
