Kitchen for working with the second level of Amlogic firmware
-------------------------------------------------- ------

Instruction:

1) to work with the second level, you must unpack level 1 (see level1.txt)

2) click _unpack_level2.bat

3) in the level2 folder, we replace / correct the files in the folders:

system - section system
vendor - vendor section
product - product section
odm - section odm

If you are adding new files or folders that require special permissions
(by default, new files and folders are assigned permissions 0644 and 0755 when packing)
then write these rights in *_fs_config.
The *_file_contexts files are required for setting SELinux privileges
And the *_size files set the size of a particular partition.

4) click _pack_level2.bat

5) then pack level 1 (press _pack_level1.bat, see level1.txt)
   to create full OTA, click _pack_level1_fota.bat

6) enjoy.
